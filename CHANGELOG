84
  removed ".headers", since i have linked needed header files
83
  copied some files over, mainly from "cppfunct", for release
81
  put a yellow background behind the "FAIL" tag in the reports, for the
  benefit of color-blind people
80
  removed the need for the "test_namespace()" macro, by using name mangling
  instead of namespaces for test nodes and test functions
79
  added a notice "this is in its early stages"
78
  documented test nodes, tests with a test function, and fixtures
77
  removed "testudo" from "testudo_test_parameters" and
  "testudo_test_arguments"
76
  some code simplifications
75
  some more cleaning
74
  some code simplifications (mainly, fused "TestNode" and "Test")
73
  added a global root test node, and a way to retrieve top nodes by name,
  while creating them if they don't exist yet; until documented, check
  related task in "TODO"
72
  added a UML diagram
71
  forgot to update success file
70
  some minor edits
69
  added an uncaught exception to the showcase test (had to shorten the test
  to stay within the one-page limit for the code and the report)
68
  documented fake-declare instruction and uncaught-exception flagging
67
  coded support for red-background error flagging in LaTeX format
66
  removed the priority in the test that goes into the documentation, in
  order to avoid early confusion
65
  added per-test detection of unexpected exceptions
64
  forgot to update the markup format for the summary
63
  managed tasks
62
  added a mention of the fixture on the report, and somewhat reworked the
  way fixture specification is implemented
61
  changed the sequence of classes and methods for the check macros; now, new
  kinds of checks can be added without changing the initial "Check<A>" class
60
  wrote some explanations about the macros in a separate text file
59
  simplified "testudo__TOL_S()"
58
  corrected some rvalue and universal reference errors, made tiny adjustments,
  and removed some obsolete code
57
  slightly improved macros, for clarity
56
  made a better syntax for tests with fixtures
55
  minor corrections
54
  added the possibility to output to LaTeX format, and used it in the document
53
  handled "@" specially (the "awk" script got confused if there were "@"
  instances in the original text)
52
  small change
51
  added an option to translate to colourful LaTeX (in a "fancyvrb"
  "Verbatim" environment
50
  finished the chapter "test steps"
49
  removed the old one-macro check instructions
48
  changed the way values are stored in special short-lived classes by the
  check instruction macros, so that lvalues are copied, and other values
  are just referenced; this makes it possible to store a non-copyable
  object for equality comparison, and use its conversion operator later,
  when the second value is available
47
  simplified type deduction in check instructions, and avoided using
  "decltype()" on the expressions, since it doesn't work with lambdas
  (something about an unevaluated context)
46
  added dependency on the test instruction macro style generator
45
  finished the section about check syntax
44
  started the description of test instruction macros
43
  added the possibility to have several styles for test instructio macro
  names, and even define your own
42
  coded a better (methinks) set of checking instruction syntax, that solves
  the problem with some expressions needing to be bracketed; didn't obsolete
  yet the old one; i'll have to remove from the doc the explanation about
  bracketed expressions
41
  wrote some structure, and some text about output formats and test
  hierarchies
40
  made scopes into their own structure
39
  first version of segregated "testudo" (from "oxys/testit")
