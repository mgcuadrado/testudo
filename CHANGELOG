  always add at least one red '-'
231
  spelling and misc corrections
230
  finished documenting Mock Turtle, by writing about checks with mock-method
  ledgers

  renamed "with()" to "with_data()"
197
  some code simplifications

  "test-arguments" aren't needed
195

  corrected "with()"-loop format for complex chained loops
158
  showed value and failed check for "with()" fails, instead of just the value
157
  added a log object that encompasses all related instances of

156
  renames to avoid name clashes
155
  simplified "with()"-loop implementation
154
  coded the negated versions of checks for "equal", "approx", and "verify"
153
  reworked "check(...)_false" so that it can be generalised to negate
  other checks
152
  added more cases for chained "with()"-loops where the inner loop is just
  a part of the outer loop's body; some formatting issues appear
151
  added a level of indirection to "to_text()" to make it more robust
150

  corrected long cartouched titles that have to be broken up in "color_text"
  format
139
  minor edits
138
  polished and shipped the "with-loop" feature
136
  ported the "with()"-loop syntax to XML; still some work to do to clean
  and generalise (for "lc"-vs-"uc", for instance)
135
  solved a bug with broken line indentation in the text color format, and
  implemented scope indentation for XML format (added a few new makefile
  targets to check-text color vs XML formats)
134
  unfinished: coded a quick-and-dirty implementation for the with-loop
  concept; for the time being, only for colour text, and only with macros in
  "testarudo.ttd", and the test that uses it is commented-out; but if you
  uncomment it, it works
133
  turned "TestFormat" bool arguments into strings, so that they can have
  other values apart from "false" and "true"
132
  new idea: with-loops
131
  made compiler commands silent (you can see them again with "make --trace")
130
  had forgotten to "-include" test (".ttd") dependencies
129
  removed the need for the "-d" option (all non-option arguments are

  libraries to load)
127
  coded dynamic loading of libraries containing tests
126
  added a table of macro names per style to the doc
125

  task to check if Testudo can be done in C++14 or even C++11
124
  removed file redundancy when copying
123 testudo-0.02
  testudo version 0.02
122
  documented new fixture features
121
  checked unexpected exceptions in hidden fixtures still report the error
120
  implemented the whole "hidden fixture" concept, by having fixture methods
  behave hidden for hidden fixtures (before that, only fixture constructor
  and destructor honoured hiddenness)
119
  coded fixture member declaration and initialisation, and a simplified
  version of hidden fixtures
118
  coded a very simple filter to show ANSI codes, so that we can compare
  the output of different test report toolchains precisely (they may differ
  unobservably, for instance in the colour in place when a space is printed)
117
  gave the "check-try-catch" instruction the possibility to specify the
  specific kind of exception
116
  added an idea
115
  corrected the summary report to show "[ERR-]" tags when appropriate
114
  refactored "xml_to_color" to make it simpler and better documented, to
  correct format across line breaks, and to have multiline cartouches for
  long contents
113
  removed filling lines that aren't needed anymore
112
  added some comments
111
  wrote some words about fatal errors, and gave some minimal content to
  each section, as a reminder of what each one is about
110
  some more details about a possible "_relapprox()" check macro
109
  made the separator ("print_break()") as wide as the line width
108
  simplified the try-check-catch report
107
  marked tests with errors as [ERR-] rather than [FAIL]
106
  make unexpected exceptions caught by the "try-catch" instruction still
  be unexpected instructions (with a rethrow)
105
  documented step IDs, and wrote some words about declarations vs actions
104
  moved the flag name of the "try-check" syntax into a new "step-id" syntax
  (this syntax can be used for any kind of step, but i first coded it as
  a way of not losing the flag name information)
103
  tiny comment about predetermined predicates
102
  documented "check-verify" syntax and predicates
101
  coded a simple predicate type and some macros to easily define and operate
  with predicates
100
  coded initial support for predicate-verifying checks
99
  cleared some confusion between value and reference
97
  added some ideas about predicates
96

90
  typo
89
  wrote a "README.md" for GitHub
88
  added a very simple example for the "README.md" documentation
87
  excluded the code example in the manual from being copyrighted
86
  testudo version 0.02rc
85 testudo-0.01
  small corrections to release procedure (copy permissions from original file
  when addind license notice; match full lines when avoiding copying files)
84
  removed ".headers", since i have linked needed header files
83
  copied some files over, mainly from "cppfunct", for release
81
  put a yellow background behind the "FAIL" tag in the reports, for the
  benefit of color-blind people
80
  removed the need for the "test_namespace()" macro, by using name mangling
  instead of namespaces for test nodes and test functions
79
  added a notice "this is in its early stages"
78
  documented test nodes, tests with a test function, and fixtures
77
  removed "testudo" from "testudo_test_parameters" and
  "testudo_test_arguments"
76
  some code simplifications
75
  some more cleaning
74
  some code simplifications (mainly, fused "TestNode" and "Test")
73
  added a global root test node, and a way to retrieve top nodes by name,
  while creating them if they don't exist yet; until documented, check
  related task in "TODO"
72
  added a UML diagram
71
  forgot to update success file
70
  some minor edits
69
  added an uncaught exception to the showcase test (had to shorten the test
  to stay within the one-page limit for the code and the report)
68
  documented fake-declare instruction and uncaught-exception flagging
67
  coded support for red-background error flagging in LaTeX format
66
  removed the priority in the test that goes into the documentation, in
  order to avoid early confusion
65
  added per-test detection of unexpected exceptions
64
  forgot to update the markup format for the summary
63
  managed tasks
62
  added a mention of the fixture on the report, and somewhat reworked the
  way fixture specification is implemented
61
  changed the sequence of classes and methods for the check macros; now, new
  kinds of checks can be added without changing the initial "Check<A>" class
60
  wrote some explanations about the macros in a separate text file
59
  simplified "testudo__TOL_S()"
58
  corrected some rvalue and universal reference errors, made tiny adjustments,
  and removed some obsolete code
57
  slightly improved macros, for clarity
56
  made a better syntax for tests with fixtures
55
  minor corrections
54
  added the possibility to output to LaTeX format, and used it in the document
53
  handled "@" specially (the "awk" script got confused if there were "@"
  instances in the original text)
52
  small change
51
  added an option to translate to colourful LaTeX (in a "fancyvrb"
  "Verbatim" environment
50
  finished the chapter "test steps"
49
  removed the old one-macro check instructions
48
  changed the way values are stored in special short-lived classes by the
  check instruction macros, so that lvalues are copied, and other values
  are just referenced; this makes it possible to store a non-copyable
  object for equality comparison, and use its conversion operator later,
  when the second value is available
47
  simplified type deduction in check instructions, and avoided using
  "decltype()" on the expressions, since it doesn't work with lambdas
  (something about an unevaluated context)
46
  added dependency on the test instruction macro style generator
45
  finished the section about check syntax
44
  started the description of test instruction macros
43
  added the possibility to have several styles for test instructio macro
  names, and even define your own
42
  coded a better (methinks) set of checking instruction syntax, that solves
  the problem with some expressions needing to be bracketed; didn't obsolete
  yet the old one; i'll have to remove from the doc the explanation about
  bracketed expressions
41
  wrote some structure, and some text about output formats and test
  hierarchies
40
  made scopes into their own structure
39
  first version of segregated "testudo" (from "oxys/testit")
