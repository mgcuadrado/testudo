# Testudo, an automatic test system for C++ code

Testudo is a framework in which you can write automatic tests for your C++
code.  Its key features are:

- tests are written in pure C++, in a clear, concise, idiomatic way;

- the check system is extensible, and comprises by default bool checks,
  equality checks, approximated checks (for floating-point types), and
  expected-exception checks;

- you can make your new classes Testudo-aware easily, so that Testudo can use
  them for checks or print their values;

- Testudo detects unexpected exceptions, and counts them as errors;

- natural support for fixtures;

- you can produce full, detailed test reports that can be understood on their
  own, without checking the source code;

- you can organise your tests as a tree;

- you can produce test summaries with success, fail, and error counts and
  accumulated tallies across the test tree.

# A simple example

Here's a very simple example of a Testudo test file, containing a test node and
a test:
```c++
#include <testudo/testudo_lc.h> // default lower-case style
#include "flux_capacitor.h"
#include "delorean_test.h" // defines DeloreanFixture

define_top_test_node("outatime.delorean", // parent full name
                     flux_capacitor, // text name
                     "flux capacitor features"); // title

define_test(flux_capacitor, // parent
            flux_capacitor_initial, // name
            "flux capacitor after construction", // title
            with_fixture(DeloreanFixture)) { // use a fixture
  declare(FluxCapacitor fc);
  perform(fc.connect_to(delorean)); // created by the fixture
  check(not fc.is_on())_true; // check bool is true
  check(fc.missing_jw())_approx(1.21); // check approximate value
}
```

Here's an equivalent Testudo test file, expressed with a different style (there
are two default styles; you can also add your own):
```c++
#include <testudo/testudo_uc.h> // default upper-case style
#include "flux_capacitor.h"
#include "delorean_test.h" // defines DeloreanFixture

DEFINE_TOP_TEST_NODE("outatime.delorean", // parent full name
                     flux_capacitor, // text name
                     "flux capacitor features"); // title

DEFINE_TEST(flux_capacitor, // parent
            flux_capacitor_initial, // name
            "flux capacitor after construction", // title
            WITH_FIXTURE(DeloreanFixture)) // use a fixture
{
  DECLARE(FluxCapacitor fc);
  PERFORM(fc.connect_to(delorean)); // created by the fixture
  CHECK(not fc.is_on()) TRUE; // check bool is true
  CHECK(fc.missing_jw()) APPROX(1.21); // check approximate value
}
```

And here's a possible output with one fail (somebody watched ze dubbed version
and didn't get zeir jigawatts right):
```
 _______________________________________________
| {testudo.outatime.flux_capacitor} FC features |
`-----------------------------------------------'
 _________________________________________________________________
| {testudo.outatime.flux_capacitor.initial} FC after construction |
`-----------------------------------------------------------------'
" with fixture DeloreanFixture "
: FluxCapacitor fc ;
# fc.connect_to(delorean) ;
% not fc.is_on()                                                        [ OK ]
% fc.missing_jw() // 1.21 +/- eps : 2.21 // 1.21 ---------------------- [FAIL]
{testudo.outatime.flux_capacitor.initial} 1/2 fail -------------------- [FAIL]

{testudo.outatime.flux_capacitor} 1/2 fail ---------------------------- [FAIL]
```
(only with colours, but `README.md` doesn't show colours).

As you can see, all details of the source code are transferred to the full
report, but results are added in the form of `[ OK ]` and `[FAIL]` tags, and
accumulated counts, and each line is coded with various characters to mark what
kind of a line is (a declaration, an action, a checkâ€¦).  When a value doesn't
match its expected value, both the actual value and the expected value are
printed, as in the check for `fc.missing_jw()`: you see the actual value `2.21`
and the expected value `1.21`.  In that same line, `+/- eps` means the
comparison used the current value for the tolerance; you can also change the
tolerance, or specify a tolerance for a specific check.

If you request just a summary instead of the full report, you get this:
```
{-.flux_capacitor} 1/2 fail ------------------------------------------- [FAIL]
    {-.initial} 1/2 fail ---------------------------------------------- [FAIL]
```

Testudo has many more features and syntax elements than i can show you
comfortably in this `README.md`.  Please refer to the
![guide](/doc/testudo.pdf).
